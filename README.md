# video_to_slide
Transform your video-lessons into PDF slides!

Just modify the file name and file extension according to the video you do want to extract slides from.
Be careful: this scripts works on any video video file, even if it is just a movie. You will have "slides" from it :) 

This project is a work-in-progess.

TODOs:
  - Improve the frames choice (some meaningful frames are skipped)
  - Add tesseract OCR after properly preparing the image
  - General performance improvements
